<li>Perform Operations with code</li>
<li>Annotate document changes: automate the creation of documentation after every build, or you can automatically annotate (注解) hand-crafted documentation. Annotated documentation can be used by people and systems. Use annotations as an input to your operations code</li>
<li>Make frequent, small, reversible changes: You want to design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. </li>
<li>Refine standard operations frequently</li>
<li>Anticipate failure: pre-mortem (事前验尸)</li>
<li>Learn from all operational failures</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Core-Services"><a href="#Core-Services" class="headerlink" title="Core Services"></a>Core Services</h1><img src="core-services.png" alt="" width="700px"/>

<ul>
<li><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> is key for operational excellence because it helps you ensure reliability. The service lets you treat infrastructure as code, and it provides templates you can use to replicate your environment.</li>
<li>To prepare, <strong>AWS Config</strong> and <strong>AWS Config Rules</strong> can be used to <em>create standards for workloads</em>, and to <em>determine whether environments are compliant with those standards before they are put into production</em>.</li>
<li><strong>CloudWatch</strong> allows you to <em>monitor the operational health of a workload</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Elasticsearch</strong> Service allows you to <em>analyze your log data to gain actionable insights quickly and securely</em>.</li>

<h2 id="Batch-Changes"><a href="#Batch-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Batch Changes"></a>Batch Changes</h2><p>Instead, make small, reversible changes</p>

<h1 id="Operate"><a href="#Operate" class="headerlink" title="Operate"></a>Operate</h1><ul>
<li>Achieve business and customer outcomes through the successful operation of a workload.</li>
<li>Manage operational events with efficiency and effectiveness. You can do this by:<ul>
<li>establishing <strong>baselines</strong> that you use to identify the improvement or degradation of operations, </li>
<li>collecting and analyzing your <strong>metrics</strong></li>
<li>then validating your understanding of how you <strong>define operational success</strong> and how it changes over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communicate the <strong>operational status</strong> of workloads. </li>
<li>Consider that operational health includes both the health of the <strong>workload</strong>, and the health and success of the operations that act upon the workload—for example, <strong>deployment and incident response</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>dashboards and notifications</strong> so that information can be accessed automatically. The more people have access to information about the health of your infrastructure, the healthier it will be.</li>

<li>Identify areas for improvement, and include <strong>feedback loops</strong> within your procedures.</li>
<li>Share “lessons learned” across teams to share the benefits of those lessons. <ul>
<li>Analyze trends within the lessons learned</li>

<ul>
<li>Continuously improving your <strong>culture</strong>. This best practice governs the way you operate. You must recognize that change is constant, and that you need to continue to experiment and evolve by acting on opportunities to improve.</li>
<li>Having a <strong>shared understanding</strong> of the value to the business. Make sure that you have cross-team consensus on the value of the workload to the business, and that you have procedures that you can use to engage additional teams for support.</li>
<li>Ensuring that you have enough personnel so that you can have an appropriate number of <strong>trained personnel</strong> to support the needs of your workload. <ul>
<li>Perform regular reviews of workload demands</li>
<li>Train existing personnel or adjust personnel capacity as needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making sure that governance and guidance are documented and accessible.<ul>
<li>Ensure that standards are accessible, readily understood, and measurable for compliance. Make sure that you have a way to propose changes to standards, and request exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using <strong>checklists</strong> to evaluate whether you are ready to operate workloads. These checklists include <strong>operational readiness checklists</strong> and <strong>security checklists</strong>.</li>
<li>Having <strong>runbooks</strong> for events and procedures that you understand well. </li>
<li>Having <strong>a playbook</strong> for failure scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing recovery</strong> so that you can identify potential failure scenarios and test your responses—for example, <em>game days</em>, and <em>failure injection</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-factors-drive-your-understanding-of-operational-health"><a href="#What-factors-drive-your-understanding-of-operational-health" class="headerlink" title="What factors drive your understanding of operational health?"></a>What factors drive your understanding of operational health?</h1><p>Best Practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining expected business and customer outcomes. Make sure that you have a <strong>documented</strong> definition of what success looks like for the workload, from business and customer perspectives.</li>
<li>Identifying <strong>success metrics</strong>. Define metrics that can be used to measure the behavior of the workload against the <strong>expectations of the business and of customers</strong>.</li>
<li>Identifying <strong>workload metrics</strong>. Define metrics that can be used to measure the status and success of the <strong>workload and its components</strong>. (Technology metrics)</li>
<li>Identifying <strong>operations metrics</strong>. Define metrics that can be used to measure the execution of <strong>operations activities</strong>, such as runbooks and playbooks.</li>
<li>Establishing <strong>baselines</strong> for metrics so that they provide expected values as the basis for comparison.</li>
<li>Collecting and analyzing your metrics. Perform <strong>regular, proactive reviews</strong> to identify trends and determine responses.</li>
<li>Validating insights. Review the results of your analysis and responses with <strong>cross-functional teams and business owners</strong>. Adjust the responses as appropriate.</li>
<li>Taking a business-level view of your operations. Determine whether you are satisfying <strong>customer needs</strong>, and identify areas that need improvement so that you can reach your <strong>business goals</strong>.</li>
<li>Determining the priority of operational events based on their <strong>impact on the business</strong>. When multiple events require intervention, priority is based on the business impact.</li>
<li>Putting processes in place to handle event, incident, and problem management. </li>
<li>Processing each alert. <strong>Any event for which you raise an alert should have a well-defined response</strong>, such as a runbook or playbook. The event should also have a specifically identified <strong>owner</strong>, such as an individual, a team, or a role.</li>
<li>Defining <strong>escalation(raise) paths</strong>. <strong>Runbooks and playbooks</strong> should have a definition for what triggers an escalation, a process for escalation, and specifically identify the owners for each action. Escalations might include third parties, such as for example, vendors, AWS Support, and others.</li>
<li>Identifying decision makers. </li>
<li>Communicating operating status through dashboards.</li>
<li>Pushing <strong>notifications to communicate with your users</strong> when the services they consume are being<br>impacted, and when the services return to normal operating conditions, such as via email or SMS.</li>
<li>Establishing a <strong>root cause analysis</strong> process that identifies and documents the root cause of an event.</li>
<li>Communicating the root cause of an issue or event. Also make sure that you tailor your communications to the target audiences.</li>
