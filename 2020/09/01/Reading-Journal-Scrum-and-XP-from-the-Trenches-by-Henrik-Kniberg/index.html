    <div class="post-content ">
        <p>(28 Aug 2020)<br>Today I started reading Scrum and XP from the Trenches, written by Henrik Kniberg. I knew about XP from the book Refactoring, and thought that this book will be a nice complementary reading for CompSci701, as Scrum/XP has so much to do with trade-offs and scope decisions.<br>Enhancing comprehensibility/alterability/testability takes time, but pays off richly as a key part of the <strong>internal quality</strong> - quality that product owners/users cannot see.</p>
<p>I am reading the English and Chinese versions as a pair - Chinese version for the speed and English version to map key terms. The Chinese version is translated by 李剑. </p>
<h1 id="Story-Backlog"><a href="#Story-Backlog" class="headerlink" title="Story/Backlog"></a>Story/Backlog</h1><p>I tried working with User Stories when working on TripTime, and found that a very helpful way of keeping track of our project progress, making decisions about priorities and trade-offs, and organising end-to-end tests. </p>
<p>Henrik gives his recommendation on the six key entries that should be included in a story:</p>
<ol>
<li>ID</li>
<li>Name (descriptive, brief, differentiable)</li>
<li>Importance (each story should have different value!)</li>
<li>Initial estimate: story point/man*day estimation (should have relative correctness)</li>
<li>How to demo (could be used as pseudo code for <strong>Acceptance Testing</strong> - I did similar thing on TripTime but called it acceptance criteria)</li>
<li>Notes (referring to supportive information, explanations, examples)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Who-can-decide-what"><a href="#Who-can-decide-what" class="headerlink" title="Who can decide what"></a>Who can decide what</h2><p>People other than the product owner can add stories to backlog, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only Product Owner can decide the <strong>importance</strong>.</li>
<li>Only Developing Team can add <strong>time estimation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Don’t-compromise-on-internal-quality"><a href="#Don’t-compromise-on-internal-quality" class="headerlink" title="Don’t compromise on internal quality"></a>Don’t compromise on internal quality</h2><p>Therefore, as a developer, I should be aware that I need to budget the time for refactoring and enhancing the maintainability of my code. The product owner might want to negotiate on this - they might want to get something that “works” (external quality) faster, without giving the time for internal quality. We shall not compromise on internal quality: ask them to make the scope smaller instead.</p>
<h1 id="Sprint-Plan-Meeting"><a href="#Sprint-Plan-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Plan Meeting"></a>Sprint Plan Meeting</h1><h2 id="Why-product-owner-MUST-be-there"><a href="#Why-product-owner-MUST-be-there" class="headerlink" title="Why product owner MUST be there"></a>Why product owner MUST be there</h2><p>Every story has three variables, and they have strong dependency on each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope (decided by product owner)</li>
<li>Importance (decided by product owner)</li>
<li>Estimation (decided by developers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct collaboration on dynamically adapt this triangle is the foundation of Scrum.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Why-never-compromise-on-Internal-Quality"><a href="#Why-never-compromise-on-Internal-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Why never compromise on Internal Quality"></a>Why never compromise on Internal Quality</h2><p>A third variable: Quality</p>
<ul>
<li>External Quality<ul>
<li>what users can feel</li>
<li><strong>Part of Scope: negotiable with product owner</strong>. A slower system with simpler UI could be released first, followed by a cleaner one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal Quality<ul>
<li>what users cannot see</li>
<li>long-term impact on maintainability and lifelong cost of ownership</li>
<li><strong>Non-negotiable</strong>: always ensure internal quality!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How to negotiate when the product owner wants a shorter estimated time but doesn’t want to “pay” by external quality: <strong>Redirect the topic back to scope</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe we could simplify error handling in the current story, and put “Advanced error handling” as a separate story to be implemented later?</li>
<li>Maybe we could reduce the priority of other stories, so that we can focus on delivering the current story sooner?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Once the product owner realise that the internal quality is non-negotiable, they are usually able to go and address other variables.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Timeboxing"><a href="#Timeboxing" class="headerlink" title="Timeboxing"></a>Timeboxing</h2><p>Timeboxing is equally helpful for sprint and <strong>meeting</strong>.<br>If the sprint meeting has reached the pre-defined timebox and no valid plan is made, still end the meeting and learn from it. Next time there will be less rejection on a longer timebox for planning meeting, after the team suffers from the poorly planned sprint.</p>
<p>This methodology will be helpful to my practices other than code. I tend to push families/friends/teammates to reach the goal, no matter how long it takes, and sometimes we just give up because it has been so long since we embarked for the goal.<br>We should <strong>box the time instead of the scope</strong>. It takes practice to make a good estimation of what can be done within the box, but this is the better approach for more efficient team work.</p>
<h2 id="Sprint-Length-Compromises-and-dynamic-adaptations"><a href="#Sprint-Length-Compromises-and-dynamic-adaptations" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Length: Compromises and dynamic adaptations"></a>Sprint Length: Compromises and dynamic adaptations</h2><ul>
<li>Shorter = More frequent delivery = More frequent Feedback = Less time on the wrong direction = Faster learning and improvement = agile movement, Often preferred by product owner.</li>
<li>Longer = More time to prepare and solve problems = Less tedious Meetings and Presentations = More “flow” working state, Often preferred by developing team.</li>
</ul>
<p>No need to spend time analysing. Get started with an acceptable length, and commit to a length after the team knows what suit us.<br>Scrum is the spirit to do, to experiment and to swiftly adapt. The spirit applies both to developing and to other decision making in my life.</p>
<h2 id="Sprint-Goal-You-have-to-have-one"><a href="#Sprint-Goal-You-have-to-have-one" class="headerlink" title="Sprint Goal: You have to have one"></a>Sprint Goal: You have to have one</h2><ul>
<li>Express it with business terms instead of technology terms.<ul>
<li>Make more money</li>
<li>Impress CEO</li>
<li>Make the system good enough to be released to real users as a beta version</li>
<li>Implement the three most important storeis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Why this sprint? Why don’t we just go for a holiday?”</li>
<li>You come back to the sprint goal during the sprint, when you are confused about what you are doing.</li>
<li>Sprint goals of all teams could be listed on a significant position of the companies’ wiki page, so that everyone in the company can come and have a look what the company is doing 👊</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Decide-what-stories-to-include"><a href="#Decide-what-stories-to-include" class="headerlink" title="Decide what stories to include"></a>Decide what stories to include</h2><img src="what-to-include-in-sprint.png" alt="" width="400px"/>

<ul>
<li>Each rectangle is a story, ranged by importance</li>
<li>Size is the estimated time by story points</li>
<li>Height of brace means estimated velocity (story points that could be finished in next sprint)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Decide-the-velocity"><a href="#Decide-the-velocity" class="headerlink" title="Decide the velocity"></a>Decide the velocity</h3><p>These three methods could be used in combination to decide the team’s velocity for the current sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive reactions: good for small team</li>
<li>Yesterday’s weather: Estimate how many stories can be included based on the velocity history of the team.</li>
<li>Man-Day available * Focus Factor estimation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Focus-Factor-Man-Day-Available-estimation"><a href="#Focus-Factor-Man-Day-Available-estimation" class="headerlink" title="Focus Factor * Man-Day Available estimation"></a>Focus Factor * Man-Day Available estimation</h4><img src="focus-factor-2.png" alt="" width="400px"/>

<img src="focus-factor.png" alt="" width="400px"/>

<img src="focus-factor-3.png" alt="" width="400px"/>

<p>Now we know we should include no more than 20 points for the current sprint, with the 50 man-days available.</p>
<h4 id="“Almost-done”-is-not-included-in-actual-velocity"><a href="#“Almost-done”-is-not-included-in-actual-velocity" class="headerlink" title="“Almost done” is not included in actual velocity"></a>“Almost done” is not included in actual velocity</h4><p>The requirement of Scrum: <strong>Get things done to a deliverable state</strong><br>If the thing is “almost done”, its value is 0 (or maybe negative)</p>
<h3 id="Story-Index-Card-and-Work-Breakdown-Structure"><a href="#Story-Index-Card-and-Work-Breakdown-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Story Index Card and Work Breakdown Structure"></a>Story Index Card and Work Breakdown Structure</h3><ul>
<li>Physical Story Index Cards that encourage engagement of the whole team.</li>
<li>Sticky note under the Index Cards for task breakdown. These details do not need to be in backlog.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will require the Scrum Master to manually update the excel from changes of the physical cards, but is worth it considering the enhancement of meeting plan efficiency.</p>
<p>This relates back to a video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FklYonNknRs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work Breakdown Structure demonstration</a> that I watched at project management course. Now the man’s talk make more sense.</p>
<h2 id="Defining-“Done”"><a href="#Defining-“Done”" class="headerlink" title="Defining “Done”"></a>Defining “Done”</h2><p>There has to be a consensus on how to define “DONE” between the product owner and the developer team.<br>Possible definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ready to be realeased any time</li>
<li>On the testing server, ready for acceptance test</li>
<li>The testing team says OK</li>
</ul>
<p>An entry in each story stating how to define “DONE” for it would be helpful, as each story may vary.</p>
<h2 id="Planning-Poker"><a href="#Planning-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Planning Poker"></a>Planning Poker</h2><p>We used this at the CompSci718/719 Project debriefing!</p>
<p>Every member should have a certain understanding of the story. The Planning Poker approach ensures that everyone is actively thinking.</p>
<h2 id="Story-v-s-Tasks"><a href="#Story-v-s-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Story v.s. Tasks"></a>Story v.s. Tasks</h2><ul>
<li>Stories are deliverable. </li>
<li>Product owners care about stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Break stories into smaller stories at the sprint planning meeting, in collaboration with product owners.<br>Break storeis into tasks with the developer team, which helps deciding the story points.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-in-TDD"><a href="#Tasks-in-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Tasks in TDD"></a>Tasks in TDD</h3><p>Almost every stories’ first task is “write a test that fails”.<br>The last task is “refactoring” (Remove any duplicate code; improve comprehensibility)</p>
